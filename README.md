# Multistep Networks for Deformable Medical Image Registration
This repository contains the implementation of a multistep networks for deformable medical image registration. In order to provide a benchmark for comparison, we integrated a monostep network for deformable registration into the framework. The framework was implemented using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
